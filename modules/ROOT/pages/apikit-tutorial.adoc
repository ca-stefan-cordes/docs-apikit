In this procedure, you build and deploy an APIkit project that imports a RAML. You run the API in Anypoint Studio, use API Console to simulate calls to the API, prepare the project for deployment, deploy the project to Anypoint Platform, and apply a policy to the API.

Studio 6.0 or later is recommended for this procedure. The API you create covers two main tasks:

* Updating vending machine data: to update the central database on each sale
* Tracking inventory: to find out if a machine is low on stock
